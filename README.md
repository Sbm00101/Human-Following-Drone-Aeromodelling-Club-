# Human-following-drone

The showcased project at Techevince is an innovative autonomous drone system that utilizes advanced technologies to track and follow humans in real-time. By integrating YOLO (You Only Look Once), a powerful object detection algorithm, with a MAVSDK Python library and a Jetson Nano board, this system achieves precise and responsive movements.

The project's core functionality lies in its ability to detect and locate the closest human target using YOLO's real-time camera data analysis. Additionally, LiDAR data is combined with the camera feed to enhance accuracy and avoid obstacles. The Jetson Nano board, with its GPU capabilities, enables onboard processing, ensuring quick decision-making for the drone's movements.

The MAVSDK Python library takes charge of controlling the drone, providing high-level APIs to send commands based on the target's position. This seamless integration ensures that the drone tracks and follows the human target accurately and responsively.

Overall, the project demonstrates the potential of combining cutting-edge technologies to create an autonomous drone system capable of tracking and following humans in real-time. Its precision, responsiveness, and integration of YOLO, MAVSDK Python library, and the Jetson Nano board set it apart as an impressive technological achievement in the field of autonomous robotics.
